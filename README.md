# Realtime-Image-Upload-VueJs-and-Firebase

#### This is a stand alone project to upload image in firebase firestore (you can use other cloude service for image) using VueJs
#### Generally we use npm to install different modules such as Vuejs,Firebase etc. But in this project I entirely used cdn for all the reqired services.
